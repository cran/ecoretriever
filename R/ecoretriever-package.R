#' ecoretriever: R interface to the EcoData Retriever.
#'
#' @section About:
#' 
#' The EcoData Retriever automates the tasks of finding, downloading, and
#' cleaning up publicly available ecological data, and then stores them in a
#' local database or csv files. This lets ecologists spend less time cleaning
#' up and managing data, and more time doing science.
#' 
#' This package lets you access the Retriever using R, so that the Retriever's
#' data handling can easily be integrated into R workflows.
